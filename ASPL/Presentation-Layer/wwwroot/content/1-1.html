<title>Introduction to Python</title>

<text>Welcome to the Introduction to Python course! Python is a powerful and versatile programming language used for a variety of applications including web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more. In this chapter, we'll cover the basics of Python programming to get you started on your journey.</text>

<subtitle>Python Basics</subtitle>

<text>Python is known for its simplicity and readability. Let's start with some fundamental concepts:</text>

<h3>1. Hello, World!</h3>

<text>The traditional first program in any programming language is the "Hello, World!" program. In Python, it's incredibly simple:</text>

<snippet>
print("Hello, World!")
  </snippet>

<text>This code will output ((Hello, World!)) to the console when executed.</text>

<h3>2. Variables and Data Types</h3>

<text>Variables are used to store data in a program. Python is dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to specify the data type of a variable explicitly. Here's an example:</text>

<snippet>
# Assigning values to variables
x = 5
y = "Hello"

# Printing variables
print(x)
print(y)
  </snippet>

<text>In this example, ((x)) is an integer, and ((y)) is a string.</text>

<h3>3. Basic Operations</h3>

<text>Python supports various arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Here's how you can perform basic arithmetic:</text>

<snippet>
# Addition
result = 10 + 5
print(result)

# Subtraction
result = 10 - 5
print(result)

# Multiplication
result = 10 * 5
print(result)

# Division
result = 10 / 5
print(result)
  </snippet>

<text>This will output:</text>
<snippet>
15
5
50
2.0
  </snippet>

<h3>4. Control Flow</h3>

<text>Control flow statements allow you to control the flow of execution in your program. Here's an example of an ((if)) statement:</text>

<snippet>
# Example of if statement
x = 10

if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
  </snippet>

<text>This will output ((x is greater than 5)) if the value of ((x)) is greater than 5.</text>

<h3>5. Loops</h3>

<text>Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly. Python supports ((for)) and ((while)) loops. Here's an example of a ((for)) loop:</text>

<snippet>
# Example of for loop
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
  </snippet>

<text>This will output:</text>
<snippet>
0
1
2
3
4
