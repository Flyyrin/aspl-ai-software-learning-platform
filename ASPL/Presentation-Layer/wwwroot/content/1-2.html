<h1 class="mt-0">Variables and Data Types</h1>

<p>In this chapter, we'll delve deeper into variables and data types in Python.</p>

<h2>Variables</h2>

<p>Variables are used to store data values in Python. Unlike some other programming languages, Python does not require declaring variables with a specific data type. The type of the variable is inferred at runtime based on the value assigned to it.</p>

<h3>Variable Naming Rules</h3>

<p>When naming variables, remember the following rules:</p>

<ul>
    <li>A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character (_).</li>
    <li>A variable name cannot start with a number.</li>
    <li>A variable name can only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _).</li>
    <li>Variable names are case-sensitive.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Data Types</h3>

<p>Python supports various data types to represent different types of data. Some common data types include:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Integer:</strong> Represents whole numbers (e.g., 5, -10).</li>
    <li><strong>Float:</strong> Represents decimal numbers (e.g., 3.14, -0.001).</li>
    <li><strong>String:</strong> Represents a sequence of characters (e.g., "hello", 'world').</li>
    <li><strong>List:</strong> Represents an ordered collection of items (e.g., [1, 2, 3]).</li>
    <li><strong>Tuple:</strong> Similar to lists, but immutable (e.g., (1, 2, 3)).</li>
    <li><strong>Dictionary:</strong> Represents a collection of key-value pairs (e.g., {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}).</li>
    <li>And more...</li>
</ul>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<p>Let's look at some examples of variables and their data types:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">
# Integer
x = 5

# Float
y = 3.14

# String
name = "Alice"

# List
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Dictionary
person = {'name': 'Bob', 'age': 25}
  </code></pre>

<h3>Type Conversion</h3>

<p>You can convert between different data types using built-in functions. For example:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">
# Convert integer to float
x = 5
y = float(x)

# Convert float to integer
z = int(3.14)

# Convert integer to string
s = str(10)
  </code></pre>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Variables and data types are fundamental concepts in Python programming. Understanding how to work with variables and manipulate data types is essential for building more complex programs. In the next chapter, we'll explore operators and expressions in Python.</p>
